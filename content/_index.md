# AWS Baseline

### How to use AWS Baseline

AWS Baseline is designed as a simple, self-serviced guide for AWS customers.

The site content contains commonly-used **design patterns**, **quickstart tutorials** and **additional reading materials** published in other AWS content platforms.  

We recommend using AWS Baseline as a starting point for getting started before diving deep into other learning materials published by AWS. 


_Disclaimer_: The content in Baseline is intended to serve as a guideline and not as an assurance. While the content in this site attempts to cover the most common best practices, do engage your AWS account team for specific advice for your account.
