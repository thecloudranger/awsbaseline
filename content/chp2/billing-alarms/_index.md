### Leveraging pay-per-use billing in AWS 

### How can I monitor my usage in AWS?

An easy way to figure out the services being used is to navigate to the account billing section and look at the current and previous bills. The bill page will show all the services that the account is billed for. Expanding each service will show a drill down to different regions and specific usage.

To get to the account section, click on the account name in the AWS console (top menu) and select “My Account.”
In the account section, under billing, you can selct **Bills**.
