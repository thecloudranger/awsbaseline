Octank is an online marketplace specializing in B2B2C e-commerce for an upcoming market that is beginning to gain traction in the Asia-Pacific region. 

They have recently secured a seed funding round and are looking to invest more into **building more capabilities** and **releasing them faster** for their new users. 

The Octank team only consists of a few members. Their application development is managed only by the CTO while the team is looking to expand in headcount. 

They are currently running their website from a simple hosting service and are exploring how AWS can help them accelerate on their **go-to-market** strategy.
